        <h2>Crazy facts about red pandas
            <hr>
        </h2>
        <div>
            <p>The red panda, also known as the "lesser panda", is an endangered
                species from Southwest China. The fact that the red panda was given the name "panda" about 50 years
                before the giant sexless panda should prove that the red panda is most definitely not a "lesser panda".
                Just like its gigantic
                wish.com knockoff the red panda eats primarily bamboo but will eat small mammals and insects on
                occasion.
                Some other facts about red pandas are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They are very solitary creatures</li>
                <li>They have the digestive system of a carnivore yet are primarily vegetarians</li>
                <li>They are born covered in fur.

                <h3>Introducing my wife to red pandas</h3>
                <p>My wife had never seen a red panda in her life and especially could never understand why I thought
                    they are the cutest looking animal in the world. So I took her to "Brew at the Zoo" in Atlanta to
                    introduce her.
                    We had quite a few drinks by the time we got to the red panda exhibit and were quite saddened to
                    find
                    out they were extremely shy. We waited for about 40 mins and were about to leave when suddenly 1
                    came out to eat and lounge around.<br>
                    My wife <b>FREAKED</b> out because it looked kinda like our <a href="Douglas.jpg"
                        target="_blank"><b>dog</b></a>
                    but red and with a longer tail. Then
                    she turned to me and in all seriousness said "Brandon, we have to steal it and take it home!"
                    We came up with several dumb plans before realizing the red panda had gone back inside. However
                    my wife was hooked on red pandas.
                    Fun fact I have actually seen Red Pandas in multiple Countries:
